# RuneScape-Gamification
Anki Gamification inspired by RuneScape, code largely written by Chat-GPT. Currently there are 3 'skills' that users can gain experience in and level up: Endurance, Recall and Speed.

Endurance: gain 1-3 XP (random drop style) for every card reviewed - aka user clicked show answer and then rated their answer by clicking again, good or easy.

Recall: gain 1 XP if user clicks 'hard' on a review, 3 XP if they click 'good' and 5 XP if they click 'easy'. No XP awarded for clicking 'again'.

Speed: gain 5 XP if user clicks Show Answer in less than 10 seconds after seeing a question, 3 XP if clicked in less than 15 seconds and 1 XP if clicked in less than 30 seconds.

When XP is awarded, the relevant skill symbols displayed on the bottom right of the screen temporarily turns orange. When there is sufficient XP to reach the next level, the users skill symbol turns green and the level is updated - over spilled XP falls into the next level.

The XP needed for the next level can be viewed by simply hovering the user's mouse over the relevant skill symbol.

Leveling and XP are based directly on RuneScape - God's speed to 99.




Hoping to add more fun animations for XP and leveling, a leaderboard, XP bonuses for reaching predefined daily goals, XP awards for reviewing done on other devices and more when Chat-GPT I get a minute - XS 12/20/22
